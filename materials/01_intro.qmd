## Pharma perspective: GxP + R `r fontawesome::fa("cube")` = `r fontawesome::fa("heart")` {.smaller}

-   Core infrastructure packages only through industry
-   Quality, burden sharing: open-source [pharmaverse](https://pharmaverse.org/) and [openstatsware](https://openstatsware.org)
-   Open methodological packages can de-risk innovative methods
-   R packages make (statistical/methodological) code
    -   testable (with documented evidence thereof, [CFR Part 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_21_CFR_Part_11))
    -   reusable
    -   shareable
    -   easier to document

## Basics of R Packages{.smaller}

What leads to a package - starting small with a script building from there

1.  Encapsulate behavior (functions)
2.  Avoid global state/variables
3.  Adopt consistent coding style
4.  Document well
5.  Add test cases
6.  Refactor and optimize code
7.  Version your code
8.  Share as 'bundle'
