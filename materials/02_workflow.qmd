## Most of us use packages

- Packages help us load optional code, data, and documentation
- A library is a directory into which packages are installed
- `install.packages()` is used to install packages into the library
- `library()` is used to load and attach packages from the library
- Remember that **package $\neq$ library**

  - man
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Typically also includes:
  - data
  - inst
  - src
  - tests
