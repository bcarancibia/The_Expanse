## Description

In R, the fundamental unit of reusable and shareable code is a package, containing helpful functions, documentation, and sometimes sample data.
Putting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects. [Jenny Bryan Package Development Course](https://github.com/posit-conf-2024/pkg-dev)

This workshop assumes you have done or familiar with package development, i.e. you have created a basic package or that you have read the [R Packages book](https://r-pkgs.org)
